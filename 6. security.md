AWS WAF:
	1. Web application Firewall
	1. Protects layer 7
	2. Deploy on ALB, API Gateway, Cloud Front, AppSync Graph QL API, Cognito user pool
	3. Define Web ACL (Web Access Control List) Rules:
		a. IP Set: up to 10,000 IP addresses - use multiple rules for more IPs.
		b. Protects from SQL injection and cross-site scripting(xss)
		c. Size Constraints, geo-match(block countries)
		d. Rate-based rules - for DDoS protection
	4. Web ACL are Regional except for cloud front.
	5. Rule group is a reusable set of rules that you can add to a web ACL
	6. Doesn't support NLB
	7. We can use Global Accelerator for fixed IP and WAF on the ALB.

AWS Shield: (Protect from DDoS Attack)
	1. Distributed Denial of Service - many requests at same time
	2. AWS Shield Standard:
		a. Free service that is activated for every AWS Customer.
		b. Provides protection from attacks such as SYN/UDP Floods Reflection attacks and other layer 3/layer 4 attacks.
	3. AWS Shield Advanced:
		a. Optional DDoS mitigation service ($3000 per month per org)
		b. Protected against more sophisticated attacks on EC2, ELB, Cloud Front, Global Accelerator, and Route53.
		c. Protect against higher fees during usage spikes due to DDoS.
		d. Shield Advanced automatic application layer DDoS mitigation automatically creates, evaluates and deploys AWS WAF rules to mitigate layer 7 attacks and 24/7 access to AWS DDoS response Team (DRP)

AWS Firewall Manager:
	1. Manages rules in all accounts of an AWS Organization
	2. Security policy:
		a. Common set of security rules.
		b. WAF rules
		c. AWS Shield Advanced (ALB, CLB, NLB, Elastic IP, CloudFront)
		d. Security Groups, Network Firewall (VPC Level) DNS Firewall
		e. Policies are created at the regional level.
	3. Rules are applied to new resources as they are created(good for compliance) across all and future accounts in your organization.

Amazon Guard Duty:
	1. Intelligent threat discovery to protect AWS Account.
	2. Uses machine learning algorithms, anomaly detection, 3rd part data
	3. Input data includes: 
		a. Cloud Trail Events - Data and Management
		b. VPC Flow Logs
		c. DNS Logs
		d. Kubernetes Audit logs
	4. Cloud watch event rules to be notified in case of findings with AWS Lambda or SNS as target.
	5. Can protect against Crypto Currency attacks (has a dedicated "finding" for it).

AWS Inspector:
	1. Security Assessments
	2. EC2 - leveraging SSM Agent, analyses the running OS against known vulnerabilities. 
	3. Assess Container Images and Lambda Functions.
	4. Send Findings to security hub and event bridge.
	5. Continuous scanning and risk score associated with all vulnerabilities for prioritization. 

AWS Macie:
	1. Fully Managed data security and privacy service that uses machine learning pattern matching to discover and protect sensitive data in AWS.
	2. Identifies - Personally identifiable information (PII).
