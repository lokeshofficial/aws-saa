Encryption in flight (SSL):
	1. Data is encrypted before send and decrypted after receiving.
	2. SSL certificates help with encryption (https)
	3. Encryption in flight ensures no man in the middle attack can happen.
Server side encryption at rest:
	1. Data is encrypted after received and decrypted before sending.
	2. Encryption and decryption keys are stored somewhere and the server must have the access.
Client side encryption:
	1. Data is encrypted and decrypted by the client.
	2. Server should not able to decrypt the data.

KMS:
	1. Key Management service.
	2. Manages encryption keys and fully integrated with IAM for authorization.
	3. Audit KMS keys usage using cloud trail.
	4. Seamlessly integrated into most AWS services (EBS, S3, RDS, SSM...)
	5. KMS Keys is the new name of KMS Customer Master Key
	6. Symmetric (AES-256 keys)
		a. Single encryption key that is used to encrypt and decrypt.
		b. AWS services that are integrated with KSM use Symmetric CMKs
		c. You never get access to the KSM Key unencrypted (must call KMS API to use)
	7. Asymmetric (RSA & ECC Key pairs)
		a. Public (Encrypt) and private key (Decrypt) pair.
		b. Used for encrypt/decrypt or sign/ verify operations.
		c. Public key is downloadable, but you can't access the private key unencrypted.
		d. Use case: encryption outside of AWS by users who can't call the KMS API.
	8. Types:
		a. AWS Managed Key: free (AWS/service-name)
		b. Customer Managed Keys (CMK) created in KMS: $1/ month
		c. Customer Managed Keys imported (must be 256-bit symmetric key) $1/ month.
		d. Pay for API call to KMS ($0.03/ 1000 calls)
	9. Automatic key rotation:
		a. AWS Managed KMS Key: automatic every 1 year.
		b. Customer-managed KMS Key: (must be enabled) automatic every 1 year.
		c. Import KMS Key: only manual rotation possible using alias.
	10. KMS Key policies
		a. Control access to KMS Keys, similar to S3 bucket policies.
		b. Difference: you cannot control access without them.
	11. Default KMS Key Policy:
		a. Created if you don't provide a specific KSM Key Policy
		b. Complete access to the key to the root use = entire AWS Account
	12. Custom KMS Key policy
		a. Define users, roles that can access the KSM Key.
		b. Define who can administrate the key.
		c. Useful for cross-account access of your KMS key.
	13. Copying snapshots across accounts:
		a. Create encrypted snapshot with your own KMS Key and attach a KMS Key policy to allow authorize cross account.
		b. In target, create a copy of the snapshot, encrypt with CMK in your account and create volumes using new snapshot.
	14. KMS Multi-region keys:
		a. Multi-Region keys have the same ID, key material, automation rotation.
		b. Each key is managed independently in each region.
		c. Use cases: global client side encryption.

	15. DynamoDB Global Tables and KMS multi region keys client side encryption
		a. We can encrypt specific attribute client side in our dynamo db. table using the Amazon Dynamo DB. encryption client.
		b. When using dynamo db. global tables, KMS keys are replicated to all regions where users can use low latency API calls to KMS in their region to decrypt the data client side
	16. Global Aurora and KMS Multi region keys.
		a. Similar to Dynamo DB Global.
	17. S3 Replication Encryption considerations:
		a. Unencrypted objects and object with SSE-S3 are replicated by default.
		b. Objects encrypted with SSE-C are never replicated.
		c. For objects encrypted with SSE-KMS 
			i. Specify which KMS key to encrypt the object within target bucket.
			ii. Adapt the KMS key policy for target key
			iii. An IAM Role should have permissions for both the keys.
			iv. KMS API throttles might happen, increase service quota
	18. AMI Sharing Process Encrypted via KMS:
		a. Share KMS keys and AMI references with target account.
		b. IAM role in target account should have permissions.
		c. When launching EC2 instance from AMI, you can specify new KMS key to re encrypt the volumes.


SSM Parameter Store:
	1. Secure storage for configuration and secrets (optional encryption with KMS)
	2. Serverless, scalable and durable
	3. Version tracking of configuration/secrets.
	4. Security through IAM and notifications through Event bridge.
	5. Integration with cloud formation.
	6. You have parameter store hierarchy
	7. TTL for force update or deleting sensitive data such as passwords.
	8. Can assign multiple policies at a time.

Secrets Manager:
	1. Newer service, meant for storing secrets.
	2. Force rotation of secrets every X days.
	3. Automate generation of secrets on rotation (uses lambda)
	4. Integration with Amazon RDS (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Aurora).
	5. Secrets are encrypted using KMS.
	6. Replicate secrets and sync across regions.
	7. Ability to promote a read replica secret to a standalone secret.
	8. Use cases: multi region apps, disaster recovery strategies, multi-region DB.

AWS Certificate Manager (ACM):
	1. Easily provision, manage and deploy TLS Certificates.
	2. Provide in-flight encryption for websites (https)
	3. Supports both public and private TLS certificates.
	4. Free of charge for public TLS certificates.
	5. Automatic TLS certificate renewal.
	6. Integration with ELB, Cloud front distributions and API Gateway.
	7. Cannot use ACM with EC2 

ACM - Requesting Public certificates 
	1. List domain names to be included in the certificate
		a. FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name): corp.example.com
		b. Wildcard Domain: *.example.com
	2. Select Validation Method: DNS Validation or Email Validation
		a. DNS Validation is preferred for automation purposes.
		b. Email Validation will send emails to contact addresses in the WHOIS database.
		c. DNS validation will leverage CNAME record to DNS config (ex. Route 53)
	3. It will take few hours to get verified.
	4. It enrolled for automatic renewal and generates certificates 60 days before expiry.

ACM - Importing public certificates:
	1. No automatic renewal, must import new certificate before expiry.
	2. ACM sends expiration events 45 days prior to expiration
		a. Days can be configured.
	3. AWS Config has a managed rule named acm-certificate-expiration-check to check expiring certificates.

API Gateway Endpoint Types:
	1. Edge Optimized (Default): for Global Clients
		a. Requests go through cloud front edge locations
		b. API Gateway still lives in only one region.
		c. TLS certificate must be in same region as Cloud front.
		d. Setup CNAME or better A-Alias record in route 53
	2. Regional:
		a. For clients within same region.
		b. Can manually combine with cloud front (more control over the caching strategies and the distribution)
		c. TLS Certificate must be imported on API Gateway, in the same region as the API Stage.
	3. Private:
		a. Can be accessed from your VPC using an interface VPC Endpoint (ENI)
		b. Use a resource policy to define access.
