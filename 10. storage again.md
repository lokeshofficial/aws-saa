Edge Computing
	1. Helps in pre process state.
	2. Machine learning at edge.
	3. Transcoding media streams.
Snowball cannot import to glacier directly. S3 first with life cycle policy move to glacier.

		i. Can be used from on premise.
		j. Deployment options:
			i. Scratch File System:
				1) Temporary storage with no replication and high burst used for short term
				2) Persistent File system: long term with replication in same AZ used for long term.
	
	5. FSx for Net App On Tap
		a. File System compatible with NFS, SMB iSCSI protocol.
		b. Move workloads running on ONTAM or NAS to AWS
		c. Works will all OS.
		d. Auto scalable.
		e. Use cases: snapshots replication, low-cost with point in time instantaneous cloning.
		f. compression and data de-duplication.
	
	6. FSx for Open ZFS
		a. Managed Open ZFS.
		b. Compatible with NFS, works with all OS
		c. Up to 1000000 IOPS with 0.5ms latency.
		d. Snapshot, compression and low cost

Hybrid cloud for storage:
	1. AWS is pushing for hybrid cloud
		a. Part of infrastructure is on the cloud and part is on premise
	2. Due to long cloud migrations, security requirements, compliance requirements or IT Strategy.
AWS Storage Gateway:
	1. Bridge between on-premises data and cloud data
	2. Use cases:
		a. Disaster recovery.
		b. Backup & restore
		c. Tiered storage
		d. On-premises cache & low-latency files access.
	3. Types:
		a. S3 File gateway:
			i. Configured S3 bucket are accessible using NFS or SMB protocol.
			ii. Most recently used data is cached in the file gateway.
			iii. Supports standard and intelligent tiering buckets.
			iv. Transition to s3 glacier using a life cycle policy.
			v. Bucket access using IAM roles for each File Gateway.
			vi. Integrated with AD for user authentication.
