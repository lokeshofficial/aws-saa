	1. Serverless is a paradigm in which the developers don't have to manager servers anymore.
	2. They just deploy code.
	3. Serverless Is pioneered by AWS Lambda but now also includes anything that's managed "databases, messaging, storage etc"
	4. Serverless doesn't mean there are no servers. It means you just don't manage servers or see them.
	5. Serverless services are:
		a. AWS Lambda
		b. Dynamo DB
		c. AWS Cognito
		d. AWS API Gateway
		e. Amazon S3
		f. AWS SNS & SQS
		g. Kinesis Data Firehose.
		h. Aurora serverless
		i. Step functions
		j. Fargate

AWS Lambda:
	1. Virtual functions - no servers to manage
	2. Limited by time - short executions.
	3. Run On-demand and scaling is automated.
	4. Pay per request and compute. With 1,000,000 request free 
	5. Integrated with whole AWS suite of services.
	6. Integrated with many programming languages.
	7. Easily monitored through cloud watch.
	8. Get more resources per function (up to 10GB of RAM)
	9. Increasing RAM will also improve CPU and network.
	10. Lambda container Image.
		a. The container image must implement the lambda runtime API
	11. Concurrency up to 1000 (can be increased).
	12. Lambda will create outside your VPC(in AWS VPC which has public internet access) so you cannot access anything inside your VPC.
	13. It will use ENI in your subnet and uses it. You need to use VPC ID in your subnets and the security groups.
	14. RDS Proxy helps in connecting to Databases and must be deployed inside your VPC if you want to access it.
	15. Deployment:
		a. Function size 50MB. Code + deployment uncompressed 250MB
		b. Environment variables 4KB.
		c. Use "/tmp" folder for other files at start up
	16. Customization at edge:
		a. Many modern application execute some form of the login at the edge.
		b. Edge function:
			i. Code that you write and attach to cloud front distributions.
			ii. Runs close to users to minimize latency.
		c. Cloud front provides two types: cloud front functions & lambda@edge.
		d. You don't have to manager any servers, deployed globally.
		e. Use case: customize CDN content.
		f. Pay for what you use and fully serverless.
		g. CloudFront Functions: (Native cloud front feature)
			i. Light weight function written in Javascript for high scale latency sensitive CDN customizations with "sub-ms" start up times that processes millions of requests/second and helps to change viewer request and response. 
		h. Lambda@edge:
			i. Scales 1000s of requests/second written in NodeJS or Python.
			ii. Used to change cloud front requests and responses:
				1) Viewer request, origin request, origin response, viewer response.
	17. Author you application in one region and cloud front replicates to its locations.


API Gateway:
	1. AWS Lambda + API Gateway: No Infrastructure to manage
	2. Supports for the web socket protocol.
	3. Handle API versioning
	4. Handle different environments (Dev, test, prod)
	5. Handle security (Authentication & Authorization)
	6. Create API Keys, handle request throttling.
	7. Swagger / Open API import to quickly define APIs
	8. Transform and validate requests and responses.
	9. Generate SDK and API specifications and caches API response.
	10. Integrate with Lambda function, http endpoint and AWS Services with API Gateway.
	11. Endpoint types:
		a. Edge Optimized (default): for global clients.
			i. Requests are routed through the cloud front edge locations. API still lives in one region.
		b. Regional: regional lambdas and can combine with cloud front.
		c. private: create VPC endpoint with resource policy to access them
	12. Authenticating through IAM roles, Cognito and custom Authorizer (own logic)
	13. Custom Domain Name https security through integration with AWS Certificate Manager(ACM).
	14. If its edge optimized endpoint then the certificate must be in us-east-1
	15. If regional endpoint certificate should be in API Gateway region.
	16. Must setup CNAME or A-Alias record in route 53
	
Step functions:
	1. Build serverless visual workflow to orchestrate your lambda functions.
	2. Can integrate with EC2, ECS and on premise servers, API Gateway SQS queues etc..
	3. Possibility of implementing human approval feature.
