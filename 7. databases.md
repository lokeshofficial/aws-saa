RDS:
	1. Relational database service.
	2. It’s a managed DB service for DB use SQL as a query language.
	3. It allows you to create database in the cloud that is managed by AWS.
		a. Postgres.
		b. MySQL
		c. MariaDB
		d. Oracle.
		e. Microsoft SQL Server.
		f. Aurora (AWS proprietary database).
	4. Advantages:
		a. Automated provisioning, OS patching.
		b. Continuous backup and restore to specific timestamp(PITR - point in time restore)
		c. Monitoring dashboards.
		d. Read replicas for improving read performance.
		e. Multi AZ setup for Disaster recovery.
		f. Maintenance window for upgrades.
		g. Scaling capacity (vertically & horizontally)
		h. Storage backed by EBS
	5. You can't SSH into instances.
	6. Storage Auto scaling:
		a. Increase storage on your RDS DB instance dynamically.
		b. If RDS detects you are running out of space it dynamically scales automatically.
		c. Avoid manual scaling your database storage.
		d. You have to set Maximum storage threshold. (maximum limit for DB storage).
		e. Useful for application with unpredictable workloads.
		f. Supports all RDS database engines.
	7. Read Replicas.
		a. Up to 5 Read replicas.
		b. Within AZ, cross AZ and Cross region.
		c. Replication is ASYNC, so reads are eventually consistent.
		d. Replicas can be promoted to their own DB.
		e. Application must update the connection string to leverage read replicas
		f. Use cases:
			i. To run reporting application and some analytics.
			ii. To redirect new workload there.
			iii. To make production application is unaffected.
		g. Used for only SELECT statements.
		h. Network cost when data goes from one AZ to another. (same region its free)
	8. Multi AZ (Disaster recovery)
		a. SYNC replication.
		b. One DNS name - automatically app failover to standby 
		c. Increase availability and free. 
		d. Failover in case of loss of AZ, loss of network, instance or storage failure.
		e. Single AZ to multi AZ with zero downtime (click on modify for the database)
			i. Following happens internally.
				1) Snapshot is taken and new DB is created and restored the snapshot.
				2) Synchronization is established between the two database.
	9. RDS Custom:
		a. Managed Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server Database with OS and database customization.
		b. RDS: Automates setup, operation and scaling of database in AWS.
		c. Custom: access to the underlying database and OS so you can 
			i. Configure settings.
			ii. Install patches.
			iii. Enable native features.
			iv. Access the underlying EC2 instance using SSH or SSM Session Manager.
		d. De-activate Automation Mode to perform your customization, better to take a DB snapshot before.

	11. One aurora instance takes writes (master)
	12. Automated failover for master is less than 30 seconds.
	13. Master + up to 15 read replicas serve reads.
	14. Supports cross region replication.
	Features:

	15. You can define subset of aurora instances as a custom endpoint.
	16. Reader end point is generally not used after defining custom endpoints.

Serverless:
	1. Automated database instantiation and auto scaling based on actual usage.
	2. Good for infrequent or intermittent or unpredictable workloads.
	3. No capacity planning needed.
	4. Pay per second, can be more cost effective.

Multi Master:
	1. In case you want immediate failover for write node (HA)
	2. Every node does R/Q vs promoting a RR as the new master.

Global Aurora:
	1. 1 prime region (read/write)
	2. Up to 5 secondary(read only) regions, replication lag is less than 1 second.
	3. Up to 16 read replicas for secondary regions.
	4. Helps for decreasing latency.
	5. Promoting another region as primary.
	6. Cross region replication takes less than 1 second.

RDS Backups:
	1. Automated Backups:
		a. Daily full backup of the database
		b. Transaction logs are backed-up by RDS every 5 minutes.
		c. 1 to 35 days of retention, set 0 to disable.
	2. Manual DB Snapshots
		a. Manually triggered by the user.
		b. Retention of backup for as long as you want.

Restore options:
	1. Using snapshot to create new database.
	2. Create backup and store in s3.

	5. RDS proxy is never publicly accessible (must be accessed from VPC)

Elastic Cache:
	1. In memory databases (Redis or Memcached.) with high performance and low latency.
	2. Helps reduce load of the databases for read intensive workloads.
	3. Helps you make your application stateless.
	4. Using Elastic cache involves heavy application code changes.
	5. It caches data and you need a invalidation strategy to update data.
	6. Cache hit and cache miss.
	7. User session data can be managed using elastic cache.
	8. 
	
Security:
	1. Doesn’t support IAM Authentication.
	2. Use Redis AUTH - password/ token system that supports SSL in-flight encryption.
	3. Memcached - supports SASL based authentication.

Patterns:
	1. Lazy Loading: all data is cached, data can become stale
	2. Write through: adds or updates data in the cache when written into DB
	3. Session store: store temporary session data in the cache using TTL

Gaming leader boards are computationally complex.
Redis Sorted sets guarantee both uniqueness and element ordering.
