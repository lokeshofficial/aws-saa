AWS Organizational Units (OU)
	1. Global service to manage multiple AWS accounts
	2. The main account is the management account. And Other accounts are member accounts(these accounts can be part of one organization)
	3. Consolidate billing across all accounts - single payment method.
	4. Price benefits from aggregated usage 
	5. Shared reserved instances and saving plan discounts across accounts.
	6. API is available to automate AWS Account creation
	7. Advantages:
		a. Multi Account vs One Account Multi VPC
		b. Use tagging standards for billing purposes
		c. Enable cloud Trail on all accounts, send logs to centralized s3 account.
		d. Establish cross account roles for admin purposes.
	8. Security: Service Control Policies (SCP)
		a. IAM Policies applied to OU or Accounts to restrict users and roles.
		b. They don't apply to management account, must have explicit allow for all services (by default IAM is allowed)
		

	
IAM roles vs Resource based policies:
	1. When you assume a role (user, application or service), you give up your original permissions and take the permissions assigned to the role.
	2. When using resource based policy the principal doesn't have to give up his permissions.
Event Bridge - security:
	1. When a rule runs it needs permissions on the target.
	2. Resource based policy: Lambda, SNS , SQS, Cloud Watch Logs, API Gateway.
	3. IAM role: Kinesis stream, system manager run command, ECS Task.
IAM Permission boundaries:
	1. Users and roles are supported.
	2. Advanced feature to use a managed policy to set the maximum permissions an IAM entity can get.
	3. Combine with Organization SCP Policies.
	4.

Amazon Cognito:
	1. Give users an identity to interact with our web or mobile application.
	2. Cognito user Pool:
		a. Serverless database of users for web & mobile app.
		b. Email & Phone number verification.
		c. MFA & Password reset
		d. Federated Identities: users from Facebook, Google, SAML.
		e. Sign in functionality for app users
		f. Integrate with API gateway & Application load balancer.
	3. Cognito Identity Pools (Federated Identity)
		a. Provide AWS Credentials to users so they can access AWS resources directly.
		b. Integrate with Cognito user pools as an identity provider.
		c. Users can then access AWS services directly or through API Gateway.
		d. IAM policies applied to credentials are defined in Cognito
		e. Default IAM roles for authenticated and guest users
		f. You can apply row level security in Dynamo DB
		
	4. Cognito vs IAM: hundreds of users, mobile users, authenticate with SAML

AWS IAM Identity center:
	1. One login (single sign-on) for all your 
		a. AWS Accounts in AWS Organizations.
		b. Business cloud applications ( eg. Salesforce, Box )
		c. SAML 2.0 enabled applications.
		d. EC2 Windows Instances.
	2. Identity providers.
		a. Built in identity store in IAM identity center
		b. 3rd party: Active Directory (AD), One Login, Okta..
	3. Multi Account Permission
		a. Manage access across AWS accounts in your organization.
		b. Permission sets: collection of one or more IAM policies assigned to users and groups to define AWS Access.
	4. Application Assignments:
		a. SSO access to many SAML 2.0 business applications.
		b. Provide required URLs, certificates and metadata.
	5. Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC)
		a. Fine grained permissions based on users attributes stored in IAM Identity center identity store
		b. Example: cost center, title, locale.
		c. Use case: define permission once, then modify AWS Access by changing the attributes.
	6. Connect to an AWS Managed Microsoft AD
	7. Connect to Self Managed Directory.
		a. Create Two way trust relationship using AWS Managed Microsoft AD.
		b. Create an AD Connector.

Microsoft Active Directory (AD):
	1. Found on any windows server with AD Domain services.
	2. Database of objects: user, accounts, computers, printers, file shares, security groups.
	3. Centralized security management, create account, assign permissions.
	4. Objects are organized in trees and group of trees is a forest.
	5. AWS Managed Microsoft AD.
		a. Create your own AD in AWS and establish connections with your on Premised AD.
	6. AD Connector:
		a. Directory Gateway (proxy) to redirect to on premise AD, supports MFA
	7. Simple AD:
		a. AD Compatible managed directory on AWS
		b. Cannot be joined with on premises AD.

AWS Control Tower:
	1.  Easy way to setup and govern a secure and compliant multi-account AWS Environment based on best practices.
	2. AWS Control Tower uses AWS Organizations to create accounts.
	3. Benefits:
		a. Automate the setup of your environment in few clicks
		b. Automate on going policy management using guard rails.
		c. Detect policy violations and remediate them.
		d. Monitor compliance through interactive dashboard.
	4. Guard Rails:
		a. Provides on-going governance for your control tower environment (AWS Accounts)
		b. Preventive Guard rails - using SCP (restrict regions across all your accounts)
		c. Detective Guard rails - using AWS Config (eg. Identity untagged resources)
