Docker:
	1. Docker is a software development platform to deploy apps.
	2. Apps are packaged in containers that can be run on any OS
	3. Apps run the same, regardless of where they're run
		a. Any machine
		b. No compatibility issues
		c. Predictable behavior 
		d. Less work and easier to maintain and deploy.
		e. Works with any language, any OS and technology.
	4. Use cases: microservices arch. , lift and shift apps from on premises to the AWS cloud.
	5. Docker images are stored in docker repositories
	6. Docker hub (https://hub.docker.com) is a public repository to find base images for many technologies or OS
	7. Amazon ECR (Amazon Elastic Container Registry) is a private repository where you can store your images.
	8. Docker is a sort of virtualization technology, but not exactly.
	9. Resources are shared with the host

Docker containers management on AWS
	1. ECS (Amazon Elastic container service) - own container platform
		a. Launch docker containers on AWS = Launch ECS Tasks on ECS Clusters.
		b. Two launch types: EC2 Launch type and Fargate.
			i. EC2 launch type: Instance must provision and maintain the infra with ECS Agent running on it to register the ECS cluster.
			ii. Fargate is serverless and no need to provision EC2 instances. To scale increase number of tasks.
		c. AWS takes care of starting and stopping containers.
		d. Two roles are needed
			i. EC2 Instance profile: Where ECS agent makes calls to ECS services, pull Docker image from ECR, referencing secrets from secrets manager and parameter store.
			ii. ECS task role: different roles for different tasks, it should be defined in task definition.
		e. ALB and NLB are supported (recommended for high throughput).
		f. ELBs are not recommended, instead use Fargate.
		g. Mount EFS file systems on to ECS tasks
		h. Works for both EC2 and Fargate launch types.
		i. Tasks running in any AZ will share the same data.
		j. Fargate + EFS = serverless.
		k. To auto scale increase the number to ECS tasks.
		l. Target tracking = scale based on target value
		m. Step scaling = scale based on alarm
		n. Scheduled scaling = scale at time/date
		o. ECS service auto scaling != EC2 Auto scaling.
		p. Fargate autoscaling is much easier to setup.
		q. You can scale EC2 instances overtime using auto scaling group scaling based on CPU utilization.
		r. Custer capacity provider helps in automatically provision and scale the infrastructure for your ECS tasks.
		
EKS (Amazon Kubernetes Service) - managed Kubernetes:
	1. Way to launch managed Kubernetes clusters on AWS.
	2. Open-source system for automatic deployment, scaling and management of containerized application.
	3. Alternative to ECS, similar goal but different API.
	4. Cloud agnostic for multiple regions, deploy one EKS cluster per region.
	5. Collect logs and metrics using cloud watch container insights.
	6. Supports EC2 and Fargate launch types.
	7. Node types:
		a. Managed Node groups:
			i. Creates and manages Nodes.
			ii. Nodes are part of an ASG managed by EKS
			iii. Supports On-Demand or Spot Instances.
		b. Self-managed Nodes:
			i. Nodes created by you are registered to EKS cluster and managed by an ASG
			ii. You can use prebuilt AMI supports on demand or spot instances.
		c. AWS Fargate.
	8. Leverages Container Storage Interface compliant driver.
	9. Need to specify Storage Class manifest on your EKS Cluster.
	10. Supports EBS, EFS, FSx for Lustre, FSx for NetApp OnTap.

ECR (Amazon Elastic containers registry) - store container images
	1. Private and public repositories.
	2. Helps in store and manage docker images
	3. Fully integrated with ECS and backed by S3
	4. Access control through IAM.
	5. Supports image vulnerability, scanning, versioning, image tags etc.

AWS App Runner:
	1. Fully managed service to deploy applications and API at scale.
	2. No infrastructure experience required 
	3. Start with your source code or container images.
	4. Automatic scaling, highly available, load balancer , encryption, VPC support and connect to database, cache and messages queue services.
	5. Use cases: web apps, APIs, micro servers, rapid production deployments.
