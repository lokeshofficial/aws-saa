Athena:
	1. Serverless query service to analyse data stored in amazon s3.
	2. Uses SQL and supports CSV, JSON, ORC, Avro and Parquet.
	3. $5 per TB of data scanned.
	4. Commonly used with Amazon quick sight for reporting dashboards.
	5. Columnar data for cost savings (less scan)
		a. Apache parquet or ORC is recommended
		b. Huge performance improvement.
		c. Use glue to convert your data to parquet or ORC.
	6. Compress data for smaller retrievals 
	7. Partition datasets in s3 for easy querying on virtual columns.
	8. Use larger files to minimize overhead.
	9. Federated queries:
		a. Allows you to run SQL queries across data stored in non relational object and custom data sources
		b. Uses data source connectors that run on AWS Lambda to run federated queries.
		c. Store results back in Amazon S3

Redshift:
	1. It is based on Postgres but its not for OLTP.
	2. Its OLAP - Online Analytics processing ( analytics and data warehousing).
	3. 10x better performance than other data warehouses, scale to PBs of data.
	4. Columnar storage of data(instead of row based & parallel query engine.
	5. Pay as you go based on the instances provisioned.
	6. SQL interface for performing the queries.
	7. BI tools such as Amazon Quick Sight or Tableau integrate with it.
	8. Vs Athena: faster queries / joins / aggregations thanks to indexes.
	9. Cluster:
		a. Leader node: for query planning, results aggregation
		b. Compute Node: for performing the queries send results to leader.
		c. Provision size in advance.
		d. You can used reserved instances for cost savings.
	10. Snapshots & DR:
		a. Redshift has no multi AZ mode.
		b. Snapshots are point in time backups of a cluster stored internally in s3
		c. Snapshots are incremental (only changes saved)
		d. You can restore a snapshot into a new cluster.
		e. Automate time and space backups ( every 8 hours or every 5Gb)
		f. Manual snapshot is retained until you delete it.
		g. You can copy snapshots to another region.
	11. Redshift spectrum:
		a. Query data that is already in s3 without loading it
		b. Must have redshift cluster available to start the query.
		c. The query is then submitted to thousands of redshift spectrum nodes.

Open search:
	1. Amazon open search is successor to amazon elastic search.
	2. With open search, you can search any field even partially matches.
	3. Its common to use open search as a complement to another database.
	4. Open search requires a cluster of instances (not serverless)
	5. Doesn’t support SQL (it has its own query language.)
	6. Ingestion from Kinesis data firehose, IoT and cloud watch logs.
	7. Security through Cognito & IAM, KMS encryption, TLS
	8. Comes with open search dashboards.
	
Amazon EMR:
	1. Elastic Map Reduce.
	2. Helps in creating Hadoop clusters(Big data) to analyse and process vast amount of data.
	3. The cluster can be made of hundreds of EC2 instances.
	4. EMR comes bundled with apache spark, HBase, Presto, Flink.
	5. EMR takes care of all the provisioning and configuration.
	6. Auto scaling and integrated with spot instances.
	7. Node Types & purchasing.
		a. Master Node: manage the cluster coordinate, manage health 
		b. Core node: run tasks and store data 
		c. Task Node: just to run tasks usually spot.
	8. Purchasing options:
		a. On Demand reliable, predictable
		b. Reserved: cost savings
		c. Spot instances: cheaper and less reliable.

Quick Sight:
	1. Serverless machine learning powered business intelligence service to create interactive dashboards.
	2. Fast, automatically scalable embeddable with per-session pricing.
	3. Use cases: business analytics, building visualizations, perform ad-hoc analysis and get business insights using data.
	4. Integrated with RDS, aurora, Athena redshift and s3.
	5. In memory computation using SPICE engine if data is imported into quick sight.
	6. Column level security.
	7. Define users and groups (standard and enterprise version).
	8. Dashboard is the read-only snapshot of an analysis that you can share.
	9. Published dashboard can share with users and groups including underlying data.

AWS Glue:
	1. Managed Extract, Transform and load (ETL) service.
	2. Useful to prepare and transform data for analytics.
	3. Fully serverless service.
	4. Glue job bookmarks to prevent re-processing old data.
	5. Glue Elastic views:
		a. Combine and replicate data across multiple data stores Using SQL
		b. Leverages a virtual table, no custom code
		c. glue monitors for changes in the source data
		d. serverless.
	6. Glue DataBrew: clean and normalize data using pre-built transformation.
	7. Glue Studio: new GUI to create run and monitor ETL jobs in glue.
	8. Glue Streaming ETL: compatible with Kinesis Data streaming, Kafka and MSK.

Lake Formation:
	1. Data lake - central place to have all your data for analytics purpose.
	2. Fully managed service that makes it easy to setup a data lake in days.
	3. Discover, cleanse, transform and ingest data into your data lake.
	4. It automates many complex manual steps (collecting, cleansing, moving cataloguing data) and de-duplicate (using ML Transforms)
	5. Combine structured and unstructured data into data lake.
	6. Fine grained access control for your applications
	7. Built on top of AWS Glue.
	
Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics:
	1. Real time analysis on Kinesis data streams or firehose using SQL.
	2. Add reference data from s3 to enrich streaming data.
	3. Fully managed, no servers to provision.
	4. Automated scaling.
	5. Pay per use
	Output:
		Kinesis data streams: create streams out of the real-time analytics queries.
		Kinesis data firehose: send analytics query results to destinations.
	6. Use Flink to process and analyse streaming data.
	7. You can run on managed cluster

Amazon MSK (Managed streaming for Apache Kafka)
	1. Fully managed and serverless, alternative to kinesis.
	2. Manage clusters, data in EBS, multi-AZ



Summary:
	1. IoT Core allows you to harvest data from IoT devices
	2. Kinesis is great for real-time data collection
	3. Firehose helps with data delivery to S3 in near real-time (1 minute)
	4. Lambda can help Firehose with data transformations
	5. Amazon S3 can trigger notifications to SQS
	6. Lambda can subscribe to SQS (we could have connecter S3 to Lambda)
	7. Athena is a serverless SQL service and results are stored in S3
	8. The reporting bucket contains analysed data and can be used by reporting tool such as AWS QuickSight, Redshift, etc…
