Disaster Recovery is about preparing for and recovering from a disaster.
What kind of disaster recovery ?
	1. On-premise => On-premise traditional DR, very expensive
	2. On-premise => AWS Cloud:  Hybrid recover
	3. AWS Cloud Region A => AWS Cloud Region B
	4. Need to define two terms:
		a. RPO: Recovery Point Objective
		b. RTO: Recovery Time Objective
	5. Strategies:
		a. Backup and restore: High RPO
		b. Pilot light:
			i. Smaller version of app is always running in cloud.
			ii. Faster than backup and restore
		c. Warm Stand by:
			i. Full System is up and running but at a minimum size
			ii. Up on disaster, we can scale to disaster load.
		d. Hot site / Multi site Approach:
			i. Very low RTO - very expensive
			ii. Full Production scale is running AWS and On Premise.
	6. Recovery Tips:
		a. Backup:
			i. EBS Snapshots, RDS automated backups/snapshots etc.
			ii. Regular pushes to S3
			iii. From on Premise: Snowball or storage gateway.
		b. High Availability:
			i. Use Route53 to migrate DNS over from Region to region.
			ii. RDS Multi AZ. Elastic Cache Multi-AZ, EFS, S3
			iii. Site to Site VPN as recovery from direct connect.
		c. Replication:
			i. RDS Replication(Cross region), AWS Aurora + Global Databases.
			ii. Database replication from on-premise to RDS.
			iii. Storage Gateway
		d. Automation:
			i. Cloud Formation / Elastic Bean stalk to re create a whole new environment.
			ii. Recover / Reboot EC2 Instances with Cloud Watch if alarm fails.
			iii. AWS Lambda functions for customized automations.
		e. Chaos:
			i. Netflix has a "simian-arm" randomly terminating EC2


DMS- Database Migration Service:
	1. Quickly and securely migrate databases to AWS.
	2. Source database remains available during the migration.
	3. Supports:
		a. Homogeneous Migrations: ex oracle to oracle.
		b. Heterogeneous Migrations: ex Microsoft SQL Server to Aurora.
	4. Continuous Data Replication using CDC.
	5. You must create an EC2 Instance to perform the replication tasks.

AWS Schema Conversion Tool (SCT):
	1. Convert your database's schema from one engine to another.
	2. Example OLTP: (SQL Server to oracle) to MYSQL, PostgreSQL, Aurora
	3. Example OLAP:(Tera Data or oracle) to Amazon Redshift.
	4. Prefer compute-intensive instances to optimize data conversions.
	5. You don't need SCT if you are migrating to same DB Engine

AWS Backup:
	1. Fully managed service.
	2. Centrally manage and automate backups across AWS Services.
	3. No need to create custom scripts and manual processes.
	4. Supported services:
		a. Amazon EC2/ EBS,
		b. RDS / Amazon Aurora / Amazon DynamoDB
		c. S3
		d. Document DB, Neptune
		e. EFS/ FSx
		f. Storage Gateway
	5. Supports cross region and cross account backups.
	6. Supports PITR for supported services.
	7. On demand and scheduled backups.
	8. Tag based backup policies.
	9. Create backup policy know as backup plan
		a. Backup frequency (Every x days/weeks, months)
		b. Backup window (certain period of time)
		c. Transition to Cold Storage (Never/days, weeks)
		d. Retention period (Always, Days, Weeks, Months)
	10. Backup Vault Lock:
		a. Enforce a WORM state for all backups that you store in your AWS Backup Vault 
		b. Additional layer of defence  to protect your backups against:
			i. Inadvertent or malicious delete operations
			ii. Alter retention periods
		c. Even root user cannot delete backups

Application Discovery Service:
	1. Plan migration projects by gathering information about on-premises data centres.
	2. Server utilization data and dependency mapping are important for migrations
	3. Agentless Discovery: VM Inventory, configuration and performance history such as CPU, memory and disk usage
	4. Agent based Discovery: System configuration, system performance, running processes and details of the network connection between systems
	5. Resulting data can be viewed within AWS Migration hub.

Application Migration Service:
	1. Lift and shift solution which simplify migrating applications to AWS.
	2. Convert your physical, virtual and cloud based servers to run natively on AWS.
	3. Supports wide range of platforms, operating systems, and databases.
	4. Minimum downtime and reduced costs.

VMware cloud on AWS:
	1. Some customers use VMware Cloud to manage their on-premises data center.
	2. They want to extend the data center capacity to AWS but keep using the VMware cloud software.
	3. Use cases:
		a. Migrate your VMware vSphere based workloads to AWS.
		b. Run your production workloads across private, public and hybrid cloud environments.
		c. Have a disaster recovery strategy.
