EC2 Instance Storage:

EBS Volume:
	1. Elastic Block Store volume is a network drive you can attach to your instance while they run.
	2. Allows instance to persist data even after their termination.
	3. They and only mount to one instance at a time.
	4. They are bound to specific AZ.
	5. It can be detached to one EC2 and attach to another one quickly.
	6. You get billed for all the provisioned capacity. You can increase the drive capacity overtime.
	7. You can control the EBS volume behaviour when EC2 Instance terminates using console or CLI.
	8. Eg. Preserve root volume when instance is terminated.
	9. If EBS optimized instances are attached. You have to pay extra charge hourly.
	10. You cant increase the size. Instead create new volume and restore snapshot.

EBS Snapshots:
	1. You can make backup of EBS volume at a point in time.
	2. Incremental backups.
	3. It uses AWS managed s3 bucket to store the snapshot.
	4. Not necessarily to detach volume to take snapshot but recommended.
	5. Can copy snapshot across region.(using S3 bucket as buffer)
	6. EBS snapshot archive: snapshot in archive tier is 75% cheaper and takes 24 to 72 hrs time to restore
	7. Recycle bin for EBS snapshots - setup rules to retain deleted snapshots so you can recover then after an accidental deletion. Specify retention ( from 1 day to 1 year)
	8. Fast snapshot restore (FSR) - Force full initialization of snapshot to have no latency on the first use.

EBS Volume Types:
	1. EBS volumes comes in 6 types.
	2. Gp2/gp3 (SSD): 
		a. General purpose SSD volume that balances price and performance for a wide variety of workloads.
		b. Cost effective, low latency.
		c. 1GB to 16TiB
		d. Gp3 - 3000IPS and throughput 125Mib
		e. Gp2 - burst IOPS to 3000
		f. Size and IOPS are linked.
	3.  IO1/IO2 (SSD): 
		a. High performance SSD volume for mission critical low latency or high throughput workloads.
		b. 16000 IOPS.
		c. IO1 / IO2 - 4GB to 16TiB
		d. Max PIOPS ( 64000 for nitro EC2 instances and 32000 for others.)
		e. Can increase PIOPS independently from storage size.
		f. IO2 has more durability and more IOPS per GB at same price as IO1.
		g. IO2 block express
			i. Sub milliseconds latency. Max PIOPS 256000 with 1000:1
			ii. Supports EBS multi-attach.
	4. St1 (HDD): 
		a. low cost HDD volume designed for frequently accessed, throughput intensive workloads.
		b. 125GB to 16TiB
		c. Max throughput 500Mb - max IOPS 500
	5. Sc1 (HDD): 
		a. lowest cost HDD volume designed for less frequent accessed workloads.
		b. Cold HDD
		c. Max throughput 250Mb - max IOPS 250
		d. Lowest cost
	6. EBS volumes are characterized in size, throughput and IOPS.
	7. Only GP2, GP3 and IO1 and IO2 are used as boot volumes. 
	
EBS multi attach:
	1. IO2 supports EBS multi attach. Bound to same AZ
	2. You can attach EBS volume to 16 instances at a time.
	3. Every instances has read and write permissions.
	4. Must use file system that's cluster aware (not XFS, EX4, etc).

EBS Encryption
	1. When you create EBS volume with encryption you will get.
		a. Data at rest is encrypted inside the volume.
		b. All data in flight moving between instances and the volume is encrypted.
		c. All snapshots are encrypted.
		d. All volumes created from snapshot.
	2. Encryption and decryption are handled transparently.
	3. No impact on latency.
	4. Leverages KMS (AES-256)
	5. Copying an unencrypted snapshots allows encryption.
	6. Snapshots of encrypted volumes are encrypted.
	7. Process of encrypting the unencrypted volume
		a. Create a EBS snapshot of the volume.
		b. Encrypt the EBS snapshot using copy.
		c. Create new volume with Encrypted EBS snapshot.
		d. Attach the new EBS volume to the instance.
		
Amazon EFS - Elastic file system:
	1. Managed NFS that can be mounted on many EC2 
	2. Multi-AZ
	3. High availability, scalable, expensive, pay per use.
	4. Use cases like content management, web serving, data sharing, word press.
	5. Uses NFSv4.1 protocol.
	6. Uses security group to control access.
	7. Compatible with Linux based AMI.
	8. Encrypt at rest using KMS.
	9. POSIX file system that has a standard file API.
	10. Performance and storage classes.
		a. EFS Scale. - 1000s of concurrency clients, 10+ GB throughput. Grows petabyte scale network
		b. Performance mode: general purpose (webservers) , Max IO (big data)
		c. Throughput mode:
			i. bursting (1TB = 50MB + burst 100MB)
			ii. Provisioned set your throughput regardless of storage size
	11. Storage Classes:
		a. Storage tiers (life cycle management feature move file after N days)
			i. Standard: for frequently accessed files
			ii. Infrequent access (EFS-IA): cost to retrieve files, lower price to store. Enable EFS-IA with a life cycle policy)
		b. Availability and durability:
			i. Standard: Multi-AZ, great for prod.
			ii. One Zone: one AZ great for dev or backup enabled by default.
				1) Over 90% in cost savings.
	12. To connect EFS between two regions use inter-connected VPC 

	EBS 	EFS
	No Multi Attach except IO2	Multi Attach
	Locked to AZ	Multi AZ
	IO increases if disk space increases	IO can be configured irrespective to disk space
	You need to take snapshot to migrate to another AZ	Multi AZ
	You can use a boot volumes	Cannot use as boot volumes.
	16 instances supported for multi attach (IO2 storage class only) in single AZ	100s of Instances across AZ
	Lowest cost 	Highest cost
	Can work with any OS	Linux Based OS
	Use HDD for cost savings	Use EFS-IA for cost saving.

AMI:
	1. Amazon machine Image. Region specific and can copy across regions
	2. AMI are customization of an EC2 Instance. Add your own software, configuration, OS and monitoring.
	3. Faster boot/ configuration time because all your software is pre packaged.
	4. Launch EC2 from public AMI or your own AMI or market place AMI.
	5. Process to create AMI:
		a. Launch EC2 instance with OS.
		b. Customize all your installations and stop the instance.
		c. Build an AMI using the EBS volume ( using snapshots).
		d. Launch other EC2 with new AMI.

EC2 Instance Store:
	1. If you need high performance hardware disk, use EC2 Instance store.
	2. Better IO Performance. Very high IOPS
	3. Lose their storage if EC2 is stopped (ephemeral)
	4. Good for buffer / cache or temporary content.
	5. Risk of data loss if hardware fails.
	6. Backups and replication are your responsibility.
	7. Size and type (HDD or SSD) of instance store depends on Instance type.
