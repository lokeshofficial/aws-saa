EC2 Basics
	1. EC2 - Elastic Compute Cloud.
	2. Mainly consists in the capability of:
		a. Renting virtual machines (EC2)
		b. Storing data on virtual machines (EBS)
		c. Distribute load across machines (ELB)
		d. Scaling the services using an auto scaling group (ASG)
	3. Network performance is based on instance types, but with enhanced networking by enabling a capacity called single root IO virtualization(SR-IOV). This results in more packets per second. (Applicable to instances that are launched in VPC)
	4. Uses key value pair to authenticate and connect to EC2 instance.
	5. DNS, Public IP are attached until instance is running.
	6. ENI and Elastic IP can be attached irrespective of instance state.
	7. For Linux you can use key pair provided, for windows you have to use it in console to generate password to login
	8. VM Import/Export is used to import VM to AWS cloud and same instances can be exported.
	9. Use tags to manage instances, you can add 10 tags per instance.
	10. Monitor and alert using cloud watch service.
	11. You can change the instance type by stopping and changing instance type and restarting it
	12. Termination protection helps to avoid terminating instances accidentally.

EC2 Sizing and configuration options.
	1. Operating Systems (OS): Linux, windows or mac OS.
	2. CPU: compute power & cores.
	3. RAM: memory.
	4. EBS & EFS: Storage space network attached.
	5. EC2 Instance store: hardware storage.
	6. ENI: network card, public IP address.
	7. Security group: Firewall rules
	8. EC2 user data: Bootstrap script

EC2 user data: 
	1. A script that runs when the instance starts for the first time. It helps to install updates, download common files etc. 
	2. It runs with root user privilege.
	3. User data is stored in instance and not encrypted. So donâ€™t include any secrets such as password or keys.

EC2 Instance Metadata:
	1. Instance metadata is data about your instance that you can use to configure or manage running instance.
	2. You can get metadata of an instance inside it with a http call to http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data

EC2 Instance Types:
	1. There are several types of instance types used based on need.
		a. Eg. M5.2xlarge
			i. M - Instance class 
			ii. 5 - generation 
			iii. 2xLarge: size within the instance class.
		b. Price charges are linear across instance types for different sizes.
	2. General Purpose:
		a. Great for diversity of workloads such as webservers.
		b. Balance between compute, memory and networking.
		c. Eg. T2.micro, T3.medium.
	3. Compute Optimized:
		a. Great for compute intensive tasks that required high performance processors. (c6g, c5, c5n etc).
		b. Batch processing workloads.
		c. Media transcoding
		d. High performance web servers
		e. High performance computing 
		f. Scientific modelling and machine learning
		g. Dedicated gaming servers.
	4. Memory optimized:
		a. Great for processing large data sets in memory workloads.
		b. High performance, relational and non-relational databases.
		c. Distributed web scale cache stores.
		d. In-memory databases optimized for BI (business intelligence)
		e. Applications performing real time processing of big unstructured data.
	5. Storage Optimized:
		a. Great for storage intensive tasks that require high sequential read and write access to large data sets on local storage.( i3, i3en, D2)
		b. High frequency online transaction processing systems (OLTP)
		c. Relational & NoSQL databases.
		d. Cache for in-memory databases (for example Redis)
		e. Data warehousing applications
		f. Distributed file systems.

Security Groups:
	1. Fundamental of network security in AWS.
	2. Max 500 security groups for each VPC.
	3. You can add 50 inbound and 50 outbound rules.
	4. Control traffic into and out of our EC2 instances.
	5. At least one security group is mandatory for instance.
	6. Only contains allow rules.
	7. Reference by IP, CIDR range or by another security group.
	8. Firewall on EC2 instance.
	9. They regulate
		a. Access to ports
		b. Authorized IP ranges v4 and v6
		c. Control inbound network and outbound network.
	10. It can be attached to multiple instances.
	11. Locked down to region / VPC combination.
	12. Does live outside the EC2 instance. (EC2 can't see blocked traffic)
	13. Good to maintain separate Security group for SSH access.
	14. If your application might not be accessible from outside it might be a security group issue.
	15. All inbound traffic is blocked by default.
	16. All outbound traffic is authorized by default.
	17. Stateful firewall, outgoing message is remembered so the response is allowed without an explicit inbound rule 


EC2 Instances Purchasing options:
	1. On Demand Instances: 
		a. Short workload, predictable pricing, pay by second.
		b. Linux or windows - bills per second after first minute, other OS billing per hour.
		c. Has highest cost with no upfront.
		d. No long term commitment.
	2. Reserved (1 & 3 Years).
		a. Reserved Instances:
			i. Upto 72% discount compared to on demand
			ii. You reserve a specific instance attributes (Instance type, regions tenancy, OS)
			iii. Reservation period - 1 Years ( + discount) or 3 years (+++ discount).
			iv. Payment options - No upfront (+), Partial Upfront (++), All upfront(+++)
			v. Reserved Instance scope - Regional or zonal
			vi. Recommended for stead state usage applications
			vii. You can buy and sell reserved instance in marketplace.
		b. Convertible reserved instances:
			i. long workloads with flexible instances.
			ii. Can change instance type, family, OS Scope and tenancy.
			iii. Upto 66% discount
	3. Savings Plans (1 and 3 years):
		a. commitment to amount of usage, long workload.
		b. For long term usage (Upto 72% discount)
		c. Commit to certain type of usage ($10/hour for 1 or 3 years).
		d. Usage beyond savings plan is billed at the on Demand price.
		e. Locked to specific instance family and region.
		f. Flexible across
			i. Instance size, OS, tenancy.
	4. Spot Instances:
		a. short workloads, cheap and you can lose instance( less reliable)
		b. Upto 90% discount compared to on Demand.
		c. Instance you can lose at any point of time if your max price is less than the current spot price.
		d. Most cost-efficient instance in AWS.
		e. Useful for workloads resilient to failures not for critical jobs or databases.
		f. Define max spot price and get the instance, instance is with you until current price < max spot price you defined. Else, you need to stop or terminate with 2 minutes grace period.
		g. Spot block: Block spot instance during specific time frames (1 to 6 bours) without interruptions. In rare situations it can be re claimed.
		h. Spot Fleets:
			i. Set of spot instance + optional on-Demand instances.
			ii. Meets the target capacity with price constraints.
			iii. Possible to launch pools and can have multiple pools so fleet can choose.
			iv. Spot fleets stops launching instances when reaching capacity or max cost.
			v. Strategies to allocate spot instances. - low price, diversified, capacity optimized.
			vi. It allows us to request spot instances with lowest price.
	5. Dedicated Hosts: 
		a. Book an entire physical server, control instance placement
		b. Allows your address compliance requirements and use your existing bound software licenses ( Per socket, Per core, Pe-VM)
		c. Purchasing options: on demand and reserved.
		d. Most Expensive option.
		e. Useful for complicated license model or strong regulatory or compliance needs.
	6. Dedicated Instance:
		a. No other customer will share your hardware.
		b. May share with other instances in same account.
		c. No control over instance placement.
	7. Capacity Reservations:
		a. Reserve capacity in a specific AZ for any duration.
		b. No time commitment or billing discounts.
		c. Combine regional reserved instances and savings plans to benefit from billing discounts.
		d. You will be charged at on demand rate whether you instance is running or not.
		e. Suitable for short-term uninterrupted workloads that needs to be in specific AZ
