AWS Summary:
	1. Publicly launched in 2004 with SQS and then launched S3 and EC2 in 2006
	2. As of 2019, AWS Holds 47% of the market with 35.5 Billion dollars annual revenue with 10,00,000 active users. Pioneer for 9 consecutive years.
	3. AWS has 30 regions, 96 availability zones contain 400+ edge locations all over the world and 13 regional edge caches.
	4. Choose region based on compliance, proximity, available services and pricing.
	5. AWS has global services like IAM, route53, cloud front and WAF but most of the services are regional scoped.

	AWS Availability zones:
	1. Each region has many availability zones(usually 3, min 2 and max 6) - ap-southeast-2a
	2. Each AZ is one or more discrete datacentres with redundant power, networking and connectivity separated from each other so they are isolated to disasters. Connected with high bandwidth ultra-low latency networking.
	3. AWS has 216 points of presence (205 edge locations and 13 regional caches) in 84 cities across 42 countries.
	4. Content is delivered to end users with low latency.
	
	IAM:
	1. IAM - Identity and access management. (Global service)
	2. Root account is created by default shouldn't be used or shared.
	3. Users are people in your organizations and can be grouped. 
	4. Groups contains only users but not other groups.
	5. Users don't have to belong to a group, and user can belong to multiple groups.
	6. 
	
	IAM Permissions.
	1. Users or groups can be assigned JSON documents called policies.
	2. These policies define permissions of the users.
	3. In AWS, you apply "Least privilege principal" - don't give more permissions to the users.
	4. 
	
	5. 

IAM Policy structure.
	1. Consists of 
		a. Version - policy language version always include "2012-10-17"
		b. Id: an identifier for the policy.
		c. Statement: one or more individual statements.
	2. Statement consists of
		a. Sid: identifier of the statement.
		b. Effect: whether the statement allows or denies access
		c. Principal: account/role/user to which the policy is applied to
		d. Actions: list of actions this policy allows or denies.
		e. Resource: list of resources to which the action is applied to
		f. Condition: conditions for when this policy is in effect (optional)
		g. 
IAM Password Policy
	1. Strong password = higher security for your account
	2. In AWS, you can setup a password policy:
		a. Setup minimum password length, includes special characters, lower case uppercase number.
		b. Allow IAM users to change their own password.
		c. Prevent password re-use.
		d. Change password after sometime (password expiration)
		
Multi-factor authenticate - MFA.
	1. Protect your root account and IAM users using password you know + security device you own.
	2. Even if password is hacked the account is not compromised.
	
How can users access AWS ?
	1. AWS Management console ( password + MFA).
	2. AWS Command line interface (CLI): protected by access keys.
	3. AWS Software Developer kit (SDK): for code: protected by access keys.
	4. Access keys are generated using management console.
	5. Users manage their own keys.
	6. Access keys are secret. just like passwords, don't share them.
	
What is AWS CLI ?
	1. A tool that enables us to interact with AWS services using commands in your command line shell.
	2. Direct access to public APIs of AWS services, you can develop scripts to manage resources.
	3. Its a open source and alternative to AWS management console.
	
What is AWS SDK ?
	1. Language specific APIs (set of libraries)
	2. Enables you to access and manage your AWS service programmatically.
	3. Embedded within your applications supports SDKs ( Javascript, python, php, .net, ruby, java, GO, nodejs, C++), mobile SDKs and IOT Device SDKs
	4. Example, AWS CLI is built on AWS SDK for python.
	
IAM role for services.
	1. Some AWS services need to perform actions based on your behalf.
	2. To do so, we will assign permissions to AWS services using AWS IAM roles.
	3. Common role:
		a. EC2 Instance role.
		b. Lambda function role.
		c. Roles for cloud formation.

IAM Security tools:
	1. IAM Credentials report (account level) - a report that lists all your account's users and the status of their various credentials
	2. IAM Access Advisor (user level) - Access advisor shows the service permissions granted to a user and when those services were last accessed.
	3. You can use this information to revise your policies.

IAM Guidelines and best practices:
	1. Don't use the root account except for AWS account setup.
	2. One physical user = One AWS user.
	3. Assign users to groups and assign permissions to groups.
	4. Create strong password policy.
	5. Use and enforce to use MFA.
	6. Create and use roles for giving permissions to AWS services.
	7. Use access keys for programmatic access (CLI and SDK).
	8. Audit Permissions of your account with IAM Credentials report.
	9. Never share IAM users & access keys.

IAM Section summary:
	1. Users: mapped to physical user. Has a password to console.
	2. Groups: contains users only.
	3. Policies: JSON document that outlines permissions for users or groups.
	4. Roles: for AWS services.
	5. Security: MFA + Password policy.
	6. Access keys: access AWS using AWS CLI or SDK.
	7. Audit: IAM Credentials report & IAM Access Advisor.
