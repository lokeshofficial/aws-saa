Cloud Watch Metrics:
	1. CloudWatch provides metrics for every services in AWS.
	2. Metric is a variable to monitor (CPU Utilization, Network In...)
	3. Metrics belong to namespaces.
	4. Dimension is an attribute of a metric (instance id, environment etc)
	5. Up to 10 dimensions per metric.
	6. Metrics have timestamps.
	7. Can create cloud watch dashboards for metrics
	8. Can create Cloud Watch Custom Metrics (for the RAM for example)

Cloud Watch Metric Streams:
	1. Continually stream cloud watch metrics to a destination of your choice with near-real-time delivery and low latency.
		a. Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose (and then its destinations)
		b. 3rd Party service provider: Datadog, Dynatrace, New Relic, Splunk, Sumo Logic..
	2. Option to filter metric to only stream a subset of them

Cloud Watch logs:
	1. Log Groups: arbitrary name, usually representing an application.
	2. Log Stream: instances within application / log files / containers.
	3. Can define log expiration policies( never expire, 30 days etc).
	4. CloudWatch Logs can send logs to:
		a. Amazon S3 (exports)
		b. Kinesis Data Streams
		c. Kinesis Data Firehose.
		d. AWS Lambda
		e. Elastic search
	5. Sources:
		a. SDK, CloudWatch Logs Agent, Cloud Watch Unified agent.
		b. Elastic Beanstalk: collection of logs from application.
		c. ECS: collection from containers.
		d. AWS Lambda: collection from function logs.
		e. VPC Flow Logs: VPC Specific logs
		f. API Gateway.
		g. CloudTrail based on filter
		h. Route53: Log DNS queries.
	6. Metric Filter & Insights:
		a. You can use filter expressions for finding IP or ERROR count in logs
		b. Metric filters can be used to trigger cloud watch alarms.
		c. Log Insights can be used to query logs and add queries to cloud watch dashboards.
	7. S3 Export:
		a. Log data can take up to 12 hours to become available for export.
		b. CreateExportTask is the API call
		c. Not real time, use log subscriptions instead.
	8. Cloud Watch logs for EC2:
		a. Use cloud watch agent on EC2 to push logs to log group.
		b. Make sure IAM permissions are correct.
		c. You can setup cloud watch agent in on-premise too
	9. Logs Agent Vs Unified Agent:
		a. Logs agent is the older version that can send data to cloud watch logs
		b. Unified agent collects additional system level metrics such as RAM, processes etc and send them to cloud watch logs. And configuration for this agent can be configured using SSM Parameter store.
	10. Cloud Watch Alarms:
		a. Used to trigger notifications for any metric.
		b. Alarm States: OK, INSUFFICENT DATA, ALARM.
		c. Period: Length of time in seconds to evaluate the metric.
		d. Target: Actions on EC2, Auto Scaling, send notifications to SNS
		e. You can combine alarms to make composite alarm to reduce alarm noise with AND and OR Conditions.
		f. Alarms can be created based on metrics filters as well.
		g. You can manually trigger alarm using set-alarm-state cloud watch API

Amazon Event Bridge events (formerly Cloud watch events)
	1. Schedule: Cron jobs (scheduled scripts)
	2. Event Patterns: Event rules to react to a service doing something.
	3. Trigger Lambda functions, send SQS/SNS messages.
	4. You can use JSON based rules to filter events and send them to Destinations.
	5. Event Buses can be accessed by other AWS account using resource based policies.
	6. You can archive events and replay archived events
	7. You can analyse events in your bus and infer the schema
	8. Schema registry allows you to generate code for your application that will know in advance how data is structured in the event bus. And schema can be versioned.
	9. You can manage event bridge using resource based policy.
		a. All events in single account from your organization etc.

Cloud Watch Container insights:
	1. Collects, aggregates and summarizes metrics and logs from containers services like ECS, EKS, Kubernetes on EC2 and Fargate.
	2. In EKS and Kubernetes, cloud watch insights is using a containerized version of the cloud watch agent to discover containers.

Cloud Watch Lambda insights:
	1. Collects, aggregates and summarizes, system level metrics including CPU time, memory, disk and network.
	2. Collects, aggregates and summarized diagnostic information such as cold starts and lambda worker shutdowns.
	3. Lambda insights is provided as a lambda layer

Cloud Watch Contribution insights:
	1. Analyse log data and create time series that display contributor data
		a. See metrics about the top-N contributors.
		b. The total number of unique contributors and their usage.
	2. Helps to find top talkers and understand who impacts system performance.
	3. Works for any AWS Generated logs (VPC, DNS etc)
	4. Find bad hosts: identify the heaviest network users or find the URL that generates most errors.
	5. You can build your own rules or use cloud watch built in rules.

Cloud Watch Application Insights:
	1. Provides automated dashboards that show potential problems with monitored applications to help isolate ongoing issues.
	2. Powered by Sage Maker. 
	3. Enhanced visibility into your application health to reduce the time it will take you to troubleshoot and repair your applications.

Cloud Trail:
	1. Provides governance, compliance and audit for your AWS Account.
	2. It is enabled by default.
	3. Get a history of events / API calls made within your AWS Account by console, SDK, CLI or AWS Services.
	4. You can put logs from cloud trail into cloud watch logs or s3
	5. You can apply it to single region or all regions (default)
	6. If resources is deleted in AWS, investigate cloud trail first.
	7. Management Events:
		a. Operations that are performed on resources in your AWS Account.
		b. Eg.
			i. Configuring Security (IAM Attach Role Policy)
			ii. Configuring rules for routing data (Amazon EC2 Create Subnet)
			iii. Setting up logging (AWS CloudTrail Create Trail).
		c. By Default, trails are configured to log management events.
		d. Can separate read events and write events
	8. Data Events:
		a. By default, data events are not logged (because of high volume operations)
	9. Cloud Trail Insights:
		a. Enable Cloud Trail Insights to detect unusual activity in your account:
		b. Eg. Bursts of IAM actions, hitting service limits etc.
		c. Analyses normal management events to create a baseline.
		d. And then, continuously analyses write events to detect usual patterns
	10. Events are stored for 90 days in Cloud Trails
	11. To keep events beyond this period, log them to s3 and use Athena.

AWS Config:
	1. Helps in auditing and recording compliance of your AWS resources.
	2. Record configuration changes overtime.
	3. Receive alerts for any changes.
	4. Regional service and aggregate them across regions and accounts.
	5. Possibility of storing configuration data into s3 and analysed by Athena.
	6. You can use AWS Managed rules or make custom config rules.
	7. Then trigger for each config change or time intervals based on configuration.
	8. Its doesn't prevent actions from happening (no deny)
	9. Remediations:
		a. Automate remediation of non-compliant resources using SSM Automation Documents.
		b. Use AWS-Managed Automation Documents or create custom automation documents.
		c. You can set remediations retries if the resource is still non-compliant after auto remediation.
	10. Notifications:
		a. Use event bridge to trigger notifications when AWS resources are non-compliant
		b. Ability to send configuration changes and compliance state notifications to SNS (all events - use SNS filtering or filter at client side)
