VPC (Virtual Private cloud):
	1. CIDR:
		a. Classless inter-domain routing - a method for allocating IPs
		b. Used in security groups and AWS networking in general.
		c. Eg:
			i. 0.0.0.0/0 all IPs
			ii. 0.0.0.0/32 one IP
			iii. 0.0.0.0/26 (0-63) 
				1) 32 - 26  = 6 (2^6 = 64 (0-63))
		d. Two components:
			i. Base IP : 192.168.0.1
			ii. Subnet Mask: /32
	2. Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) established certain blocks of IPv4 addresses for the use of private (LAN) and public (internet) address.
	3. Private IPS : 10.0.0.0 (Big networks), 172.16.0.0 (AWS default VPC in that range), 192.168.0.0( Eg. Home Networks)

Default VPC:
	1. All accounts have default VPC and if EC2 instance is launched into default VPC if no subnet is specified.
	2. Default VPC has internet access and has public IPs and private IPv4 DNS names
	3. You can have multiple VPCs in your account (Max 5 soft limit).
	4. Min CIDR range is 5.
	5. Min: /28 (16 IPs) Max: /16 (65536 IPs)
	6. CIDR should not overlap with your other networks

Subnets:
	1. AWS Reserves 5 IP addresses in each subnet (first 4 and last 1). You cant assign them to your EC2 instances.
		a. 10.0.0.0 - Network Address.
		b. 10.0.0.1 - reserved by AWS for the VPC router
		c. 10.0.0.2 - reserved by AWS for mapping to AWS provided DNS.
		d. 10.0.0.3 - reserved for future use.
		e. 10.0.0.255 – Network Broadcast Address. AWS does not support broadcast in a VPC, therefore the address is reserved
	2. Subnet is AZ level service.
	3. Public subnet (route table redirects to internet)
	4. Private subnet (route table didn't redirect to internet)
	5. VPN-Only (traffic redirects to VPC VPG)
	6. Regardless to type IP ranges are always private.
	7. Default VPC contains one subnet in each AZ per region with net mask of /20.

Route Table:
	1. Logical construct with in an VPC that contains set of rules (routes) that applies to subnet to determine where network traffic is directed.
	2. Route table permits EC2 instance within different subnets in a VPC communicate with each other.
	3. You can specify subnets which are public (redirect traffic to internet gateway)
	4. Each route table contains a default route called local route to redirect traffic with in VPC.

DHCP Option sets
	1. Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
	2. Standard for passing configuration information to hosts on a TCP/IP network.
	3. AWS automatically creates and associates a DHCP option set for your Amazon VPC upon creation and sets
		a. DNS (Amazon provided DNS) 
		b. Domain-name (defaulted to the domain name for your region)
		c. NTP servers - IP addresses of up to 4 NTP servers (Network Time Protocol)
		d. Netbios-name-servers - the IP addresses of up to 4 NetBIOS name servers, separated by commas
		e. Netbios-node-type - set this value to 2
Internet Gateway:
	1. Allows resources to connect to internet. Need to create manually.
	2. One IGW to one VPC.
	3. You can add multiple route tables in VPC and assign subnets to the route tables.
	4. Performs network address translation for instances that has public IP address
	5. Add routes to internet gateway for all IPs other than CIDR range of subnets to connect to internet.

Bastion Hosts:
	1. We use bastion host to SSH into our private EC2 instances.
	2. The bastion server is in the public subnet and security group of bastion should allow port 22 from restricted public CIDR range (corporate network).
	3. The Private EC2 instances security group should allow SSH from bastion server IP or security group of bastion host.

NAT Instance(outdated):
	1. NAT - Network Address Translator.
	2. Allows EC2 instances in private subnet to connect to internet.
	3. Instance should be in public subnet.
	4. Must disable source and destination check.
	5. Must have elastic IP attached to it.
	6. Route table must configured to route traffic from private subnets to NAT instance. 
	7. Preconfigured Linux Ami is available. 
	8. Not highly available and traffic bandwidth depends on EC2 instance type.
	9. You must manage security groups.
	
NAT Gateway:
	1. AWS managed NAT - higher bandwidth, high availability, no admission. 
	2. Pay per hour for usage and bandwidth. 5GBPS to 45 GBPS.
	3. It is created in a specific AZ and uses Elastic IP. Bounded to AZ
	4. Can't be used by instances from the same subnet 
	5. Requires IGW ( Private subnet => NATGW => IGW)
	6. No security groups to manage.
	7. Resilient within a single AZ and we must create NAT for each AZ for fault tolerance.

NACL:
	1. Network access control list.
	2. Stateless Firewall which control traffic from and to subnets.
	3. One NACL per subnet type (public or private). New subnets are assigned to default NACL.
	4. You define NACL rules.
		a. Rules have a number(1-32766), higher precedence with a lower number.
		b. First rule match will drive the decision.
		c. • Example: if you define #100 ALLOW 10.0.0.10/32 and #200 DENY 10.0.0.10/32, the IP address will be allowed because 100 has a higher precedence over 200
		d. Last rule is an asterisk (*) and denies a request in case of no rule match.
		e. AWS recommends adding rules by increment of 100
		f. Newly created NACLs will deny everything.
		g. These are great way to block Specific IPs a subnet level
		h. Don't modify default NACL. Instead, create custom NACLs
	5. Ephemeral ports.
		a. For any two points to establish a connection they should use ports.
		b. Clients connects to defined port and expect a response from ephemeral port.
		c. Different Operating Systems use different port ranges, examples: • IANA & MS Windows 10 è 49152 – 65535 • Many Linux Kernels è 32768 – 60999
