	1. Two types of sharing of data between applications are synchronous and asynchronous.
	2. Sync apps are problematic with heavy traffic.
	3. Decouple applications using SQS, SNS, Kinesis.
	4. These services can scale independently from our application

SQS:
	1. Oldest offering, fully managed service to decouple apps.
	2. Unlimited throughput and number of messages in queue.
	3. Message retention till 14 days.
	4. Low latency with 256KB per message sent.
	5. Can have duplicate messages
	6. Can have out of order messages.
	7. Consumers poll SQS for messages (up to 10 messages)
	8. Consumer has to delete message using "DeleteMessage" API
	9. In-flight encryption using HTTPS API and at rest using KMS keys. Client side can be done
	10. IAM Polices to regulate SQS API.
	11. SQS Access Policies (similar to s3 bucket policies)
		a. Cross account and other services access to write into an SQS queue
	12. After message is polled, it becomes invisible for some point of time. You can change it using "message visibility timeout" is 30 seconds.
	13. You can wait up to 20 seconds after polling to get data. This is called long polling that decreases number of API calls
	14. Change wait time using "WaitTimeSeconds" API 
FIFO:
	1. Limit throughput 300 msg/s without batching, 3000 msg/s with 
	2. Exactly once send capability(removes duplicates)
	3. Messages are processed in order.
You can use SQS as buffer for database or transactions.
	
SNS (Simple Notification Service):
	1. One producer and many consumers (Receivers)
	2. 12,500,000 subscriptions per topic
	3. 1,00,000 topics limit.
	4. Integration with many AWS services.
	5. You can publish using SDK for public endpoint.
	6. Inflight and at rest encryption and client side encryption.
	7. IAM policies regulate access to the SNS API.
	8. Cross account and other services can Access 
	9. JSON policy used to filter messages and sent to SNS topic's subscriptions
FIFO:
	1. Ordering by message group id.
	2. De duplication, SQS FIFO queues as subscribers.
	3. Limit throughput

SNS+SQS: Fanout 
	1. Push once in SNS, receive in all SQS queues that are subscribed.
	2. Fully decoupled, no data loss
	3. SQS allows for data persistence, delayed processing and retries of work.
	4. Ability to add more SQS subscribers over time
	5. Check access policies and supports cross region delivery

AWS Kinesis:
	1. Makes it easy to collect, process and analyse streaming data in real time.
	2. Ingest real-time data such as: application logs, metrics, website clickstreams, IoT telemetry data.
	3. Kinesis Data Streams:
		a. Captures, process and store data streams.
		b. Retention between 1 to 365 days.
		c. Ability to reproduce (replay) data.
		d. Once data is inserted in Kinesis, it can't be deleted.
		e. Data that shares the same partition goes to same shard (ordering)
		f. Producer: AWS SDK, Kinesis producer library (KPL). Kinesis Agent.
		g. Consumer: Kinesis client library (KCL), AWS SDK. 
		h. Service like AWS Lambda, Kinesis Data firehose and data analytics.
		i. Capacity modes:
			i. Provisioned mode: choose shards and pay per use.
			ii. On-Demand mode: no need to provisioned pay per data streamed and time.
		j. Control access / authorize using IAM
		k. In flight and at rest encryption. Client side as well
		l. VPC endpoint available to access within VPC.
		m. Monitor API calls with cloud trail
	4. Kinesis Data Firehose:
		a. Fully managed, no administration, automatic scaling, serverless.
			i. AWS: redshift / S3 / Elastic search.
			ii. 3rd party partner: Splunk, mongo DB, Data Dog, new relic
			iii. Custom send to any http endpoint.
		b. Pay per data going through firehose
		c. Near real time, 60 seconds latency minimum for non batches. Or 1MB data at a time.
		d. Supports many data formats, conversions, transformations, compression.
		e. Send failed or all data to a backup s3 bucket. 
	5. Kinesis Data Analytics.
	6. Kinesis Video Streams
	7. You can order data into different shards using partition key
	8. Difference between Kinesis Data Streams and Kinesis Data firehose.
		a. 

		

Amazon MQ:
	1. SQS, SNS are cloud native services proprietary protocols from AWS.
	2. Traditional applications running from on-premises may use open protocols such as MQTT, AMQP, STOMP etc.
	3. When migrating to cloud you can use MQ instead of re engineering the application.
	4. Runs on server supports multi AZ with failover.
	5. Doesn't scale as much as SQS, SNS, but integrates with SQS and SNS services.
